# FAQ

## General

### What is Kofi?
Kofi is a next-generation liquid staking platform on Aptos, allowing Aptos users to earn boosted staking rewards through Kofi's Liquid Staking tokens, kAPT & stkAPT.

Kofi offers boosted liquid staking, whereby Kofi's yield bearing staked asset provides staking yields as the base layer yield with additional boosted rewards accrued on top of it.  

### How do I stake with Kofi?
Simply head to our website and get started!

### What is liquid staking?
Liquid staking allows users to stake their tokens without sacrificing liquidity. This is achieved through the creation of liquid staking tokens, which are on-chain representations of staked assets and serve as claims on the underlying staking positions.

Liquid staking works similarly to traditional staking. The value of your liquid staked assets increases through staking rewards, making it a straightforward staking tool rather than a speculative asset. It is also a more capital efficient form of APT as you are earning yield while holding the token.

### Has Kofi been audited?
Kofi is currently undergoing vigorous auditing from top-tier audit partners. All audit reports will be posted in Security Audits.

## Staking & Unstaking

### How long does it take to stake and unstake?
**Minting & Staking**: Once users use APT to mint kAPT on the Kofi website, they will instantly receive kAPT instantly. Staking kAPT to stkAPT is instant as well.

**Normal Unstaking**: 14 days, based on Aptos underlying 14 days unstaking lockup duration. 

**Instant Unstaking**: Instantly via swapping on our DEX partners

### How can I get kAPT?
- Mint kAPT with APT directly on Kofi
- Trade for kAPT directly on Aptos DEXs or aggregators like Panora

### How can I get stkAPT?
- Stake kAPT, receive stkAPT on Kofi
- Trade for stkAPT directly on Aptos DEXs or aggregators like Panora

### Where are my APT tokens?
When you deposit your APT tokens, Kofi automatically allocates them to top-performing validators on Aptos. In exchange, you'll receive kAPT tokens in your wallet. kAPT can be unstaked to redeem back the underlying APT at a 1:1 exchange rate on Kofi.

## Yields & Fees

### How do I collect my yield?
The token's yield accrues in its price rather than an ongoing distribution. 

The base value of stkAPT (relative to kAPT) increases over time through accruing staking rewards. It is also a more capital efficient form of APT as you are earning yield while holding the token, and can be used as collateral within Aptos DeFi. stkAPT boosted rewards are accrued via additional innovative methods of capturing yields on Aptos.

The amount of kAPT redeemable by 1 stkAPT grows daily, thanks to the compounding effect of staking rewards. For instance, if 1 stkAPT equal to 1 kAPT on day 1 and the staking APR is 7%, 1 stkAPT will be worth at least 1.07 kAPT after one year. This daily appreciation means stkAPT consistently becomes more valuable in terms of kAPT. 

Users can claim these rewards either by unstaking their stkAPT back to APT or trading it through our DEX partners on Aptos.

### Are staking rewards staked automatically?
Staking rewards are compounded automatically.

### What fees does Kofi charge?
Kofi currently charges 0% protocol fees. No fees on staking or unstaking.
