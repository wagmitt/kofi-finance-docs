Understand the fee structure for using Kofi Finance services.

## Deposit Fee

The deposit fee has a variable rate equivalent to one epoch's worth of staking rewards. This fee is applied at the time of deposit and helps maintain protocol stability while preventing gaming of the system

## Performance Fee

The performance fee is set at a rate of 10% of staking rewards. It is deducted automatically from staking rewards and is used to support ongoing protocol development and maintenance activities.
